## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**AccessType** | **string** | The access type for delivering messages to consumer flows. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;exclusive\&quot;&#x60;. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;exclusive\&quot; - Exclusive delivery of messages to the first bound consumer flow. \&quot;non-exclusive\&quot; - Non-exclusive delivery of messages to bound consumer flows in a round-robin (if partition count is zero) or partitioned (if partition count is non-zero) fashion. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] 
**ConsumerAckPropagationEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the propagation of consumer acknowledgements (ACKs) received on the active replication Message VPN to the standby replication Message VPN. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;true&#x60;. | [optional] 
**DeadMsgQueue** | **string** | The name of the Dead Message Queue (DMQ). Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;#DEAD_MSG_QUEUE\&quot;&#x60;. | [optional] 
**DeliveryDelay** | **long?** | The delay, in seconds, to apply to messages arriving on the Topic Endpoint before the messages are eligible for delivery.

**MaxTtl** | **long?** | The maximum time in seconds a message can stay in the Topic Endpoint when &#x60;respectTtlEnabled&#x60; is &#x60;\&quot;true\&quot;&#x60;. A message expires when the lesser of the sender assigned time-to-live (TTL) in the message and the &#x60;maxTtl&#x60; configured for the Topic Endpoint, is exceeded. A value of 0 disables expiry. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;0&#x60;. | [optional] 
**MsgVpnName** | **string** | The name of the Message VPN. | [optional] 
**Permission** | **string** | The permission level for all consumers, excluding the owner. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;no-access\&quot;&#x60;. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;no-access\&quot; - Disallows all access. \&quot;read-only\&quot; - Read-only access to the messages. \&quot;consume\&quot; - Consume (read and remove) messages. \&quot;modify-topic\&quot; - Consume messages or modify the topic/selector. \&quot;delete\&quot; - Consume messages, modify the topic/selector or delete the Client created endpoint altogether. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] 
**RedeliveryDelayEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable a message redelivery delay. When false, messages are redelivered as-soon-as-possible.  When true, messages are redelivered according to the initial, max and multiplier.  This should only be enabled when redelivery is enabled. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] 
**RedeliveryDelayInitialInterval** | **int?** | The delay to be used between the first 2 redelivery attempts.  This value is in milliseconds. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;1000&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] 
**RedeliveryDelayMaxInterval** | **int?** | The maximum delay to be used between any 2 redelivery attempts.  This value is in milliseconds.  Due to technical limitations, some redelivery attempt delays may slightly exceed this value. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;64000&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] 
**RedeliveryDelayMultiplier** | **int?** | The amount each delay interval is multiplied by after each failed delivery attempt.  This number is in a fixed-point decimal format in which you must divide by 100 to get the floating point value. For example, a value of 125 would cause the delay to be multiplied by 1.25. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;200&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] 
**RedeliveryEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable message redelivery. When enabled, the number of redelivery attempts is controlled by maxRedeliveryCount. When disabled, the message will never be delivered from the topic-endpoint more than once. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;true&#x60;. Available since 2.18. | [optional] 
**RejectLowPriorityMsgEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the checking of low priority messages against the &#x60;rejectLowPriorityMsgLimit&#x60;. This may only be enabled if &#x60;rejectMsgToSenderOnDiscardBehavior&#x60; does not have a value of &#x60;\&quot;never\&quot;&#x60;. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional] 
**RejectLowPriorityMsgLimit** | **long?** | The number of messages that are permitted before low priority messages are rejected. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;0&#x60;. | [optional] 
**RejectMsgToSenderOnDiscardBehavior** | **string** | Determines when to return negative acknowledgements (NACKs) to sending clients on message discards. Note that NACKs cause the message to not be delivered to any destination and Transacted Session commits to fail. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as rejectLowPriorityMsgEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;never\&quot;&#x60;. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;always\&quot; - Always return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard. \&quot;when-topic-endpoint-enabled\&quot; - Only return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard when the Topic Endpoint is enabled. \&quot;never\&quot; - Never return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] 
**RespectMsgPriorityEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the respecting of message priority. When enabled, messages are delivered in priority order, from 9 (highest) to 0 (lowest). Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional] 
**RespectTtlEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the respecting of the time-to-live (TTL) for messages. When enabled, expired messages are discarded or moved to the DMQ. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional] 
**TopicEndpointNameFilter** | **string** | A wildcardable pattern used to determine which Topic Endpoints use settings from this Template. Two different wildcards are supported: * and &gt;. Similar to topic filters or subscription patterns, a &gt; matches anything (but only when used at the end), and a * matches zero or more characters but never a slash (/). A &gt; is only a wildcard when used at the end, after a /. A * is only allowed at the end, after a slash (/). Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60;. | [optional] 
**TopicEndpointTemplateName** | **string** | The name of the Topic Endpoint Template. | [optional]

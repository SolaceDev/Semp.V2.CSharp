## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**AccessType** | **string** | The access type for delivering messages to consumer flows bound to the Topic Endpoint. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;exclusive\&quot;&#x60;. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;exclusive\&quot; - Exclusive delivery of messages to the first bound consumer flow. \&quot;non-exclusive\&quot; - Non-exclusive delivery of messages to bound consumer flows in a round-robin (if partition count is zero) or partitioned (if partition count is non-zero) fashion. &lt;/pre&gt;  Available since 2.4. | [optional] 
**ConsumerAckPropagationEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the propagation of consumer acknowledgements (ACKs) received on the active replication Message VPN to the standby replication Message VPN. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;true&#x60;. | [optional] 
**DeadMsgQueue** | **string** | The name of the Dead Message Queue (DMQ) used by the Topic Endpoint. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;#DEAD_MSG_QUEUE\&quot;&#x60;. Available since 2.2. | [optional] 
**DeliveryCountEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the ability for client applications to query the message delivery count of messages received from the Topic Endpoint. This is a controlled availability feature. Please contact support to find out if this feature is supported for your use case. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. Available since 2.19. | [optional]

**Permission** | **string** | The permission level for all consumers of the Topic Endpoint, excluding the owner. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;no-access\&quot;&#x60;. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;no-access\&quot; - Disallows all access. \&quot;read-only\&quot; - Read-only access to the messages. \&quot;consume\&quot; - Consume (read and remove) messages. \&quot;modify-topic\&quot; - Consume messages or modify the topic/selector. \&quot;delete\&quot; - Consume messages, modify the topic/selector or delete the Client created endpoint altogether. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] 
**RedeliveryDelayEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable a message redelivery delay. When false, messages are redelivered as-soon-as-possible.  When true, messages are redelivered according to the initial, max and multiplier.  This should only be enabled when redelivery is enabled. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] 
**RedeliveryDelayInitialInterval** | **int?** | The delay to be used between the first 2 redelivery attempts.  This value is in milliseconds. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;1000&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] 
**RedeliveryDelayMaxInterval** | **int?** | The maximum delay to be used between any 2 redelivery attempts.  This value is in milliseconds.  Due to technical limitations, some redelivery attempt delays may slightly exceed this value. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;64000&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] 
**RedeliveryDelayMultiplier** | **int?** | The amount each delay interval is multiplied by after each failed delivery attempt.  This number is in a fixed-point decimal format in which you must divide by 100 to get the floating point value. For example, a value of 125 would cause the delay to be multiplied by 1.25. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;200&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] 
**RedeliveryEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable message redelivery. When enabled, the number of redelivery attempts is controlled by maxRedeliveryCount.

The default value is &#x60;true&#x60;. Available since 2.18. | [optional] 
**RejectLowPriorityMsgEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the checking of low priority messages against the &#x60;rejectLowPriorityMsgLimit&#x60;.

**RejectLowPriorityMsgLimit** | **long?** | The number of messages of any priority in the Topic Endpoint above which low priority messages are not admitted but higher priority messages are allowed. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;0&#x60;. | [optional] 
**RejectMsgToSenderOnDiscardBehavior** | **string** | Determines when to return negative acknowledgements (NACKs) to sending clients on message discards. Note that NACKs cause the message to not be delivered to any destination and Transacted Session commits to fail. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as rejectLowPriorityMsgEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;never\&quot;&#x60;. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;always\&quot; - Always return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard. \&quot;when-topic-endpoint-enabled\&quot; - Only return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard when the Topic Endpoint is enabled. \&quot;never\&quot; - Never return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] 
**RespectMsgPriorityEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the respecting of message priority. When enabled, messages contained in the Topic Endpoint are delivered in priority order, from 9 (highest) to 0 (lowest). Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled and ingressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change.

**RespectTtlEnabled** | **bool?** | Enable or disable the respecting of the time-to-live (TTL) for messages in the Topic Endpoint. When enabled, expired messages are discarded or moved to the DMQ. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional] 
**TopicEndpointName** | **string** | The name of the Topic Endpoint. | [optional]
